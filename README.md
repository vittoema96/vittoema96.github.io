> # ‚ö†Ô∏è Fan Project ‚ö†Ô∏è
> I'm an inexperienced Programmer / Game master and a forever Fallout fan.
> This is a fan project made:
> - Mainly for my group
> - By a non-native english speaker
> - To learn stuff: there may be bugs, shitty code, etc.
> - By only me, in my free time, so updates may be frequent or stop altogether.

> # ‚ö†Ô∏è **WORK IN PROGRESS** ‚ö†Ô∏è
>
> This project is currently under active development. Many features are incomplete, and you may encounter bugs.
>
> It has not been tested on all devices or screen sizes. It is primarily designed for mobile devices and tested on a screen size of approximately **412x915px** (though generally any "normal" mobile device should be ok and desktop "should" work, but it still has some funky layouts).



# Pip-Boy 3000 - PWA Companion App

![Pip-Boy 3000](https://vittoema96.github.io/img/icons/512x512.png)

A responsive, installable Progressive Web App (PWA) designed as a companion for the Fallout-themed tabletop RPG. This app allows players to manage their character's stats, skills, inventory, and perform dice rolls directly from their browser or installed on their device.

The interface is heavily inspired by the iconic Pip-Boy 3000 from the Fallout series, featuring FO3 and FNV themes to match your favorite game.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

If you want to mess with the code (good luck lol):

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # Start dev server
npm run build    # Build for production
npm run quality  # Check code quality (lint + format + types)
```

**Version management** (because I got fancy with semantic versioning):
```bash
npm run version:show        # Show current version
npm run version:next-alpha  # Bump to next alpha milestone
```

## üèóÔ∏è How it's built

**Tech stack**: React 18, Vite, i18next, PapaParse
**Structure**:
```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/      # React components (tabs, inventory, popups, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ contexts/        # React contexts (Character, Popup, Tooltip)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/           # Custom React hooks (useI18n, useDataManager, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ js/              # Legacy vanilla JS (kept for reference)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ locales/         # i18n translation files (en.json, it.json)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ styles/          # CSS styles

public/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/            # Game data in CSV files
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ img/             # Images and icons
```

**Key architecture**:
- **React Components**: Modular UI components with hooks
- **Context API**: Global state management (character, popups, tooltips)
- **Custom Hooks**: Reusable logic (data loading, i18n, inventory actions)
- **CSV Data**: Game content loaded dynamically with PapaParse

## üé≤ Game mechanics

Implements proper Fallout 2d20 rules:
- **D20 rolls**: Skill + SPECIAL vs difficulty, count successes
- **D6 damage**: Multiple dice, reroll 1s and 2s, count effects/damage
- **Combat**: Attack rolls consume ammo, armor reduces damage
- **Character origins**: Different stat caps (Super Mutants, etc.)

## üìä Data format

Game data is in CSV files for easy editing:
- `public/data/weapon/` - Weapons with damage, range, ammo type
- `public/data/apparel/` - Armor with DR values and protection areas
- `public/data/aid/` - Consumables with effects

## üìà Versioning

Uses semantic versioning: `0.0.3-alpha.0`
- `0.0.x` = Alpha milestone (patch = milestone number)
- `0.1.0` = Beta phase
- `1.0.0` = Stable release

GitHub Actions automatically increments build numbers on deploy.

## ü§ù Contributing

Just follow the existing code style. Run `npm run quality` to check everything is good.

See [TODO.md](TODO.md) for what needs to be done.
