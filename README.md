# Pip-Boy 3000 - PWA Companion App

![Pip-Boy 3000](https://vittoema96.github.io/img/icons/512x512.png)

A responsive, installable Progressive Web App (PWA) designed as a companion for the Fallout-themed tabletop RPG. This app allows players to manage their character's stats, skills, inventory, and perform dice rolls directly from their browser or installed on their device.

The interface is heavily inspired by the iconic Pip-Boy 3000 from the Fallout series, featuring FO3 and FNV themes to match your favorite game.
